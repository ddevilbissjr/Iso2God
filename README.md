# Iso2God
Decompiled Iso2God for quality of life improvements

This mod adds:
- select or drag and drop multiple ISO files at once, all files are added automatically to the list, you can edit them after as needed
- output as ISO only when you want to rebuild an ISO with full padding removed
- delete the source ISO and / or the GOD package after conversion / FTP upload
- use correct game names from game list files
- resizable main window
- ui "optimization" stuff
- various fixes for xbox (og): redump files are now supported, thumbnail images should read correctly
